Zebonastic.ai is a series of experiments to better understand how LLMs inperpret prompts and write up the results in Zebonastic.ai Magazine.

The Zebonastic team is developing a translator that converts grammatically correct sentences into a simplified language called "botspeak." This language is specifically designed to be understood by bots, with a focus on testing it with Midjourney (MJ) to visualize the results. The translator's development involves analyzing over 100 million public MJ messages to identify keywords that MJ comprehends.

The main goal of this translator is to bridge the communication gap between human language and bot comprehension. While bots do not understand language in the same way humans do, the translator aims to facilitate communication between humans and bots by transforming sentences into a format that bots can easily understand. This format is designed to be a sequence of tags that can be easily modified by a human.

Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5, do not possess a deep understanding of grammar and have a limited grasp of syntax. They are trained on extensive amounts of text data, enabling them to learn patterns, grammar rules, and syntactical structures present in the training data. LLMs can generate text that adheres to grammatical rules and exhibits coherent syntactic structures.

However, it's important to note that LLMs lack explicit knowledge or a profound understanding of grammar like humans do. Their understanding of syntax is based on statistical patterns learned from the training data. While LLMs can generate text that appears to be syntactically correct, they may still produce grammatically incorrect or nonsensical sentences in certain contexts or when faced with ambiguous or uncommon language patterns.

It's also worth mentioning that the performance of LLMs in understanding and generating syntax can vary based on their architectures and training data. Therefore, while LLMs have some understanding of syntax, their proficiency may not always match that of humans.

To draw an analogy, using translation tools when traveling to a foreign country can greatly assist in understanding and being understood by others, although it is possible to survive without them. Similarly, the translator being developed by the Zebonastic team aims to enhance understanding between humans and bots, leading to improved communication.
